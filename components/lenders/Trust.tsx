        </h2>

          K2 is not a lead marketplace. Our borrowers go through a structured
          education process designed to align them with lender expectations before
          they ever submit a request. The result is a relationship-driven network
          where lenders receive prepared, respectful, and informed applicants - not
          cold inquiries. When you join K2, you join a community that values
          transparency, preparation, and long-term partnerships.
